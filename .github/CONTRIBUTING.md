# Contributing to goyave.dev

Thank you very much for your time contributing to the Goyave framework!

All pushes on `master` trigger a build and deployment of the website. Therefore, unfinished documentation and WIPs take place in branches. You can open your pull requests on the `master` branch. Although spelling is checked in CI, please double-check before opening your pull request.

Try to be precise and include as much information as possible in your documentation.
